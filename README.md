# DS-utils

Collection of utilities for DS. It works on pure python, you need dependencies ndstool.exe in the folder.

## Utilities:
- [x] Unpacking the ROM
- [ ] Packaging the ROM (temporarily does not work for unknown reasons. I recommend using other utilities)
- [x] Emulator (if the window does not close for unknown reasons, then I can only advise killing the process in the task manager)
- [ ] Changing the ROM name
- [ ] Music Extraction
- [ ] Editing scripts

## Dependencies

```pip install ndspy```

```pip install psutil```

```pip install py-desmume```
